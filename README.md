# GSoC 2015 proposal: Multivariate Survival analysis
Test results and proposal for GSoC 2015

See the [proposal](proposal/Monaco-gsoc2015.pdf?raw=true). The completed test is reproduced below.

Simulation results
==================

Simulations were performed with R version 3.1.3 running in an Ubuntu 12.04 desktop with AMD Phenom 9550 Quad-Core 2.20 GHz Processor. All of the simulation results are obtained using penalized partial likelihood estimation, namely the coxph function in the survival package with the Breslow method. Each simulation was repeated 500 times to obtain the empirical mean and SD. The empirical censorship and runtime (in seconds) are also reported. For more information, see Section [sub:Simulation].

See Appendix B of the [proposal](proposal/Monaco-gsoc2015.pdf?raw=true). Tables will be reproduced here soon...
